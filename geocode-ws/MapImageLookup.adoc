= Map Image Lookup

The classes in `org.gbif.geocode.ws.layers` each refer to a link:src/main/resources/org/gbif/geocode/ws/layers/[PNG bitmap rendering] of their layer, with each region having a unique colour, and off-layer areas being white. Borders and some other areas are black, and are still looked up using the database. This allows for over 90% of queries to avoid querying the database. Queries to these areas are almost instant, for some layers off-layer queries (e.g. international water) can be particularly slow using the database.

The class `MyBatisGeocoder` refers to a combined PNG bitmap of all the default layers, and works in the same way.

== Process to generate the map image

All the bitmaps are generated by link:src/main/java/org/gbif/geocode/ws/util/BitmapGenerator.java[BitmapGenerator].

It uses PostGISâ€™s ability to export SVG shapes/paths, plus a very simple SVG template, and a method to generate unique colours for each area. The Batik library is used to render the PNG. The intuitive option of setting `shape-rendering="crispEdges"` to disable anti-aliasing is, unfortunately, not appropriate. This leads to tiny areas and tiny holes being omitted from the bitmap:

.Bitmap created with `crispEdges`.  The yellow line is the true path from the database, tiny island "holes" in the Australian EEZ are not marked in the bitmap.

Instead, we use an image rendered with `shape-rendering="geometricPrecision"`:

.Note that all the holes are outlined in the bitmap
image::docs/eez-0.2-geometricPrecision-crop.svg[hollow,width=360,align="center"]

and set any non-white pixel in this image to black in the coloured image:

image::docs/eez-0.2-combined-crop.svg[combined,width=360,align="center"]

Generating the SVGs and converting them to bitmaps is slow, and for some layers takes a huge amount of RAM (40GB+), so the results are committed to the repository.

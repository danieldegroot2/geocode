# geocode-ws

RESTful service that provides the reverse geocode functionality. The REST resource should be accessible at this URL: `http://{server}:{httpPort}/reverse`.

## How to build this project

No credentials are hardcoded. You can provide credentials in one of multiple ways:

For these two remember not to check your changes in:
 - Change the src/resources/mybatis.properties file
 - Change the src/resources/mybatis-config.xml file

 - Provide the connection details on the command line while running Maven:
    ```-Dgeocode-ws.url=<url> -Dgeocode-ws.username=<user> -Dgeocode-ws.password=<password>```

 - Provide the connection details in a profile in your settings.xml file:

```xml
<profile>
  <id>geocode-ws</id>
  <properties>
    <geocode-ws.url></geocode-ws.url>
    <geocode-ws.username></geocode-ws.username>
    <geocode-ws.password></geocode-ws.password>
  </properties>
</profile>
```

Then start Maven with this profile: `-Pgeocode-ws`

### Building

To build the WebService just execute Maven this way:

```mvn clean package```

And make sure to provide database credentials in one of the ways mentioned above.

## Testing

To run the WebService in a local Jetty instance run

```mvn jetty:run```

And make sure to provide database credentials in one of the ways mentioned above.

Then go to: http://localhost:8080/geocode-ws/reverse?lat=55.68&lng=12.00

Response should be:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "PA:6"
    "id": "6"
  }
]
```

## Create Database

At the moment we have two sources of data: Natural Earth and EEZ.

Natural Earth (we're currently on version 3.1.0):
Download the [1:10m Cultural Vectors, Admin 0 - Countries file](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-countries/)
and the [1:10m Cultural Vectors, Admin 0 - Details map units file](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-details/).

```
unzip ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip
shp2pgsql -d -D -s 4326 -i -I -W UTF-8 ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp public.political > political.sql
psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <database> -f political.sql

unzip ne_10m_admin_0_map_units.zip
shp2pgsql -d -D -s 4326 -i -I -W UTF-8 ne_10m_admin_0_map_units.shp public.political_map_units > political_map_units.sql
psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <database> -f political_map_units.sql
```

EEZ (we're currently on version 8):
Download the Low res version from here: http://vliz.be/vmdcdata/marbound/download.php

```
unzip World_EEZ_v8_20140228_LR.zip
shp2pgsql -d -D -s 4326 -i -I -W WINDOWS-1252 World_EEZ_v8_2014.shp public.eez > eez.sql
psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <database> -f eez.sql
```

Add the indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX political_iso_a3
  ON political
  (iso_a3);

CREATE INDEX eez_iso_3digit
  ON eez
  (iso_3digit);
```

Import Svalbard, Jan Mayen and Bouvet Island, which are missing from a supposedly-with-territories Norway.

```
DELETE FROM political WHERE sovereignt = 'Norway';
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE no_sj_bv AS SELECT * FROM political_map_units WHERE sovereignt = 'Norway';
UPDATE no_sj_bv SET gid = gid + (SELECT MAX(gid) FROM political);
INSERT INTO political (SELECT * FROM no_sj_bv);
```

Change some areas to use different ISO codes:

```
-- SELECT * FROM political WHERE adm0_a3 IN('HKG','MAC','USG','CNM','CYN','ESB','WSB','FRA','KAB','SAH','SOL');

UPDATE political SET iso_a2 = 'CN' WHERE adm0_a3 IN('HKG','MAC');
UPDATE political SET iso_a2 = 'CU' WHERE adm0_a3 = 'USG';
UPDATE political SET iso_a2 = 'CY' WHERE adm0_a3 IN('CNM','CYN','ESB','WSB');
UPDATE political SET iso_a2 = 'FR', iso_a3 = 'FRA' WHERE adm0_a3 = 'FRA';
UPDATE political SET iso_a2 = 'KZ' WHERE adm0_a3 = 'KAB';
UPDATE political SET iso_a2 = 'MA' WHERE adm0_a3 = 'SAH';
UPDATE political SET iso_a2 = 'SO' WHERE adm0_a3 = 'SOL';
UPDATE political SET iso_a2 = 'ZZ' WHERE iso_a2 = '-99';

UPDATE eez SET iso_3digit = 'FRA' WHERE iso_3digit IN('REU','GLP','GUF','MTQ','MYT');
```

## Map image for faster lookups

There is a PNG image used to speed up queries â€” roughly half the world's area can be determined without referring to the database at all.

![PNG map cache](./src/main/resources/org/gbif/geocode/ws/service/impl/world.png)

See [Map Image Lookup](./MapImageLookup.md) for how the image is created.

## How to run this service

This service is based on the [gbif-microservice](https://github.com/gbif/gbif-microservice) project which means that the
jar file can be executed using the parameters described in the [gbif-microservice](https://github.com/gbif/gbif-microservice)
project; additionally, this service requires a logback.xml file in the `conf` directory located at same level where the
jar file (such directory is added to the application classpath).
